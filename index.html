          Sharkiya, S. H. (2023). Quality communication can improve patient-centered health outcomes among older patients: A rapid review. <em>BMC Health Services Research, 23</em>(1), 886. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-023-09869-8" target="_blank">https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-023-09869-8</a>
        </p>
        <p class="summary">
          This article examines how effective communication strategies, including both verbal and non-verbal approaches, significantly improve patient-centered outcomes for older adults. The study highlights the importance of communication techniques such as active listening, eye contact, and clear explanations to build trust and enhance patient satisfaction. Specific strategies like the teach-back method and non-verbal cues, such as nodding and gentle touch, are explored as impactful tools for improving care delivery. This resource provides practical insights into how nurses can tailor communication to meet the needs of older patients, improving their understanding and adherence to treatment plans. Nurses can use this resource to identify communication strategies that foster trust, reduce misunderstandings, and improve health outcomes among older adults. This is particularly useful during discharge planning or follow-up care for elderly patients.

        <p class="summary">
          This peer-reviewed study explores the experiences of nursing professionals with patient-centered communication and highlights the challenges they face, including dealing with aggressive patients, managing emotional stress, and addressing language barriers. The authors conducted focus group interviews with 31 nurses across diverse medical disciplines and identified key skills needed for effective communication, such as empathy, managing escalating situations, and communicating about serious illness, death, and dying. This study provides valuable insights into the communication challenges nurses experience daily and underscores the need for structured communication skills training (CST) tailored to various clinical settings. Nurses can utilize the study findings to reflect on their communication practices and prioritize skill development in areas such as de-escalation techniques, cultural sensitivity, and addressing end-of-life conversations. Healthcare leaders can use this resource to design effective CST programs that meet nurses' needs and improve patient care outcomes.

        <p class="summary">
          This systematic review investigates the characteristics, outcomes, and implementation strategies of community-based culturally tailored education (CBCTE) programs designed to address chronic diseases, including diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and stroke, in Black communities. The review synthesizes findings from 74 studies, predominantly conducted in the United States, highlighting the use of five culturally tailoring strategies: peripheral, evidential, linguistic, constituent-involving, and sociocultural. Key outcomes included improved physiological measures, health literacy, and medication adherence. This article provides a comprehensive overview of how culturally tailored interventions can reduce health disparities and improve health outcomes for Black adults. It is particularly useful for healthcare providers and educators seeking to design programs that are culturally responsive and community-driven. Healthcare administrators and program designers can utilize the insights from this review to implement CBCTE programs tailored to specific cultural and linguistic needs. The strategies outlined in the study are applicable across various chronic diseases and can inform the development of patient education materials and intervention frameworks that prioritize cultural competence.

        </p>
        <p class="summary">
          This article reviews the critical aspects of care coordination and continuity within primary healthcare (PHC) systems. It identifies three key levels of care coordination: individual (e.g., relational continuity between patients and providers), organizational (e.g., multidisciplinary collaboration and integrated care), and system-wide (e.g., multisectoral coordination across health and non-health sectors). The review highlights the benefits of effective care coordination, such as improved patient outcomes, reduced healthcare costs, and enhanced service efficiency. Challenges, such as fragmented care, poor communication, and resource limitations, are also explored. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of care coordination and its importance in PHC systems. It is particularly valuable for understanding the organizational and system-level dynamics of healthcare coordination, making it relevant for initiatives focused on improving workflow integration and multidisciplinary collaboration. Healthcare providers and administrators can use this study to identify areas of improvement in care coordination and continuity. The findings can guide the development of strategies to strengthen communication, integrate care across sectors, and address challenges such as resource shortages and service fragmentation. This resource is especially useful for designing training programs and workflow models that emphasize continuity of care.
